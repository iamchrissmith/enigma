# DTR Memo || Project: Enigma

## Group Member Names: Natalia Colome, Chris Smith

## Goals and expectations:
We would like to finish the project while meeting all expectations and trying extensions. We hope to increase our understanding of encryption through this project.  We also look forward practice pairing on a project.

## Team strengths:
- Proactive
- Willing to learn and work
- Look for feedback
- Experience writing an encryption program
- Project planning experience

## How to overcome obstacles:
When faced with an obstacle, we plan on:
 1. work harder together on solving the issue
 2. if that doesn't work, we will step away
 3. come back to approach from a different angle
 4. set a time limit for when we get stuck

## Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually?):
Mornings 8-9
Lunch
Evenings can do 4-7
Weekend: Saturday Flexible and Sunday afternoon (post 2pm)

##Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?):
We will communicate frequently on the pieces of the project.  Our primary method will be face to face. However, we may also lean on Slack and Screenhero for non-in-person communication.

## Abilities Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
We both felt comfortable that we would be able to write the logic for this program.  So we would like to focus on breaking this logic into single purpose methods through encapsulation and keeping the methods short.  We want to be better Test Driven Development.

## Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
Largely, we plan on working on the features of this project together.

## Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests):
We will work in-person on features using the Driver/Navigator method.  If we decide to divide-and-conquer then we will use:
- Branched features
- then review code together
- merge/do pull Requests

## Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
We are both OPEN and want all the feedback, don't hold back.

## Agenda to discuss project launch:
- Review project requirements
- Talk about features/development phases
- Decide on pair styles
- Plan feature/deliverable schedule

## Ideas:
- "White Board" pseudo code to break down the logic

## Tools:
- Git
- Rake / Minitest
- Rubocop
- SimpleCov
- Devver's Construct (for Mock file testing)
- Slack
- VS Code / Atom
